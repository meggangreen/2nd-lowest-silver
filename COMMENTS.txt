The program is written in Python 3.6. It requires the program module
-- slcsp.py -- and the three CSV files -- slcsp, zips, and plans -- to be in the
same directory.

From the command line, run $ python slcsp.py (you can substitute another Python
interpreter).

If you also wish to run the testing module, you must have write permissions for
the program directory. The testing and dataset modules must be in the same dir.
